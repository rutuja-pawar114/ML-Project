# 🥊 Fight Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the **prize money (fight purse)** awarded to a fighter based on various features such as fighter stats, match event details, and opponent information. The goal is to assist event planners, analysts, and fans in estimating fighter payouts based on historical data.

## 🤖 Modeling

We experimented with several ML models:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks (optional)

Best performance came from: **XGBoost Regressor**

Metrics used:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score
